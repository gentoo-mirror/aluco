		The spacenavd daemon can be used directly as a drop-in replacement. It
		can communicate with the official magellan SDK, and thus any program
		compiled with it can work with spacenavd transparently without any
		change or need of recompilation.
		Also, spacenavd provides an alternative communication protocol, for
		programs that use libspnav, that doesn't require an X server, as the
		original protocol does.
